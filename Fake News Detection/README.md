OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient algorithm that can detect and classify fake news articles from genuine news articles, to improve the quality and reliablity of information available to the public.

INTRODUCTION

In today's digital age, the spread of fake news has become a major concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. With the vast amount of information available online, it can be difficult for people to distinguish between real and fake news articles. This project aims to address this issue by developing a machine learning algorithm that can accurately and efficiently detect and classify fake news articles from genuine ones based on their content and source. By improving the quality and reliability of information available to the public, this project has the potential to contribute to a more informed and educated society.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the Fake News Detection Dataset has proven to be a valuable resource for training and evaluating fake news detection models. The high accuracy achieved by various classification algorithms highlights the effectiveness of the dataset and the potential of machine learning techniques in distinguishing between real and fake news articles.

Through the utilization of Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest Classifier, the models achieved impressive accuracy rates. Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 97.30%, SVM achieved 97.60%, and Random Forest Classifier achieved 96.21%. These results indicate the robustness of the models in accurately classifying news articles and their potential for practical deployment in real-world applications.
